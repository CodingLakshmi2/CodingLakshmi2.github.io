                development of culture, and engineering spaces </h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                Overview: What is engineering, what are its principles over time, and how can we design globally with a
                positive mindset
                <br>
                <br>
                Engineering uses scientific principles to reflect on building and creating to build structures and make
                sense of the nonsense. It requires superimposing a structure to create a mechanistic and holistic
                perspective of how different ideas interact within a system and the potential consequences of a device.
                <br>
                <br>
                The most important thing about engineering though, is that it requires tinkering and taking risks to
                develop solutions and experiment with different ideas. Anyone can belong in engineering - with the
                unique perspectives and personalities we all have the ability to reshape innovation and build access for
                creativity.

                </br>
                <u>LITTLE DESCRIPTION: </u> designing an instrument using materials from your home requires
                understanding its different components, and evaluating what you need. We’re here to help - develop your

                Mentorship for design: Mentorship is an influential part of developing teamwork and personal growth. It
                allows you to reach your goals and develop a growth mindset through working with someone with more
                experience to learn what kind of leader you want to be.
                </br>
                </br>
                Some tips with mentors:
                - Let them know about your personality, really shine! Explain your story of resilience and learning
                </br>
                - Let the mentor know what you are expecting out of the relationship and any relevant experience you
                have
                (it’s okay if you don't)
                Show them a project you’ve been working on, let them know of any hobbies you have
