    <h1> Engineering - Sustainable Engineering </h1>

    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <p class="pTag">
      Sustainable Engineering will benefit us in a multitude of ways. The very definition of the term is to design and
      engineer systems that use energy and resources at a rate that does not harm the environment or the ability of
      future generations to meet their own needs. Additionally, sustainable engineering allows us to minimize waste,
      thus the eco-friendly statement. Currently, waste is a very big factor in why climate action is so necessary now.
      Engineering in such a way that is sustainable and effective solutions will allow us to cut energy costs, cut down
      waste, be eco-friendly, and benefit us as well as our future generations!
    </p>

    <h2> Engineering Design Process (EDP) </h2>
    <p class="pTag">
      The Engineering Design Process consists of seven stages. You will first define the issue. This entails finding a
      problem with does not yet have a solution or a noneffective one. The second step is to ask questions and compile
      solutions. Then you should imagine how the solutions would work and cut down on worse ideas to make room for
      refinement of the better, more effective solutions. Subsequently, you will plan for the project ahead of you by
      defining variables and set parameters for your project. You will then make a digital (such as CAD) or physical
      model of your solution. Finally, you will test your solution and improve it as needed.

    <h1> Computer Science - Sustainable Engineering </h1>

    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <p class="pTag">
      Sustainable Engineering mingles with Computer Science quite frequently. A common example of this occurring solar
      panels. We use solar panels a lot, though we may not realize this. Another common example of CS involving
      Sustainable Engineering is wastewater treatment. We use this commonly to remove as many substances and to purify
      the water as much as possible before releasing it back into the environment, providing cleaner water for future
      generations and allowing for the environment to recycle the lingering waste for our drinking water.

    <h1> Computer Science & Engineering (Combined) - Sustainable Engineering </h1>

    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <p class="pTag">
      Some examples of what you could do in both Computer Science and Engineering to create a better and more
      sustainable world is utilizing advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence to solidify facts,
      prove old theories wrong, find new solutions to old and new problems, and to provide a more honest approach to
      problems in our world that desperately need it.
