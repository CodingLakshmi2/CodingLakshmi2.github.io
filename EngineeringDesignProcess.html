    <h1> Engineering Design Process (SDP)</h1>
    <p class="pTag">
      This process is used for almost all the time if you are an engineer. This process helps us cut down our work and
      go step by step instead of jumping into the "creating part" and mess it up later. It's for the better if we follow
      this process, because it has been proven that by using this process you can create a much "efficient" product than
      you normally would.
    </p>

    <!--     <img src="" alt="Pic of the Design Process">
 -->
    <h1 class="h1"> STEP 1: Identify </h1>
    <ul>
      <li class="li-process"> You MUST Identify your problem/need before you step into doing anything else. </li>
      <li class="li-process"> By identifing the problem you can understand what exactly is the problem and why are you
        asked to create a
        solution. As well as understanding the concept well before you get into the building part. </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="h1"> STEP 2: Describe </h1>
    <li class="li-process"> There are two stages in this step. One is Describing the need, and the second one if
      Characterizing and
      Analysing that system. </li>
    <li class="li-process"> You also must keep repeating that process until you have a very refined need and can
      describe it crystal
      clearly. </li>

    <h1 class="h1"> STEP 3: Generate </h1>
    <li class="li-process"> This step is very crucial since, you have to generate the perfect idea or solution to your
      problem you have
      identified </li>
    <li class="li-process"> You have to think out the box sometimes in order to get this step correctly. </li>
    <li class="li-process"> This step could also take much longer since you have to either keep building upon your ideas
      or generate new
      ones. So, patinece and creativity are the key for this step. </li>

    <h1 class="h1"> STEP 4: Embody </h1>
    <ul>
      <li class="li-process"> Finally you are in the building stage. It could either be a protype where you literally
        build something or
        use a Computer to generate something </li>
      <li class="li-process"> This step could take years if not decades to perfect your project. And this process takes
        three steps in
        order to successdully complete the product </li>
      <li class="li-process"> First, you need to create a prodotype. Second you must test and evaluate your prototype.
        And finally, Third,
        you need to refine your prototype based on the advice, bugs, or commetns you recieved on your prototype and
        polish it until perfection. </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="h1"> STEP 5: Finalize </h1>
    <ul>
      <li class="li-process"> Your last and final STEP is to finalize your project and submit or publish it somewhere.
      </li>
      <li class="li-process"> If an app, website, or a product designed on a computer, you can publish it somewhere. But
        if it's a protoype
        you built then you </li>
    </ul>
